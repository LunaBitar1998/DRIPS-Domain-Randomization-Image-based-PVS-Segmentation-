	# We can now provide various parameters to control the preprocessing of the input.
	# First we can play with the size of the input. Remember that the size of input must be divisible by 2**n_levels, so the
	# input image will be automatically padded to the nearest shape divisible by 2**n_levels (this is just for processing,
	# the output will then be cropped to the original image size).
	# Alternatively, you can crop the input to a smaller shape for faster processing, or to make it fit on your GPU.
    cropping = 512
	# Finally, we finish preprocessing the input by resampling it to the resolution at which the network has been trained to
	# produce predictions. If the input image has a resolution outside the range [target_res-0.05, target_res+0.05], it will
	# automatically be resampled to target_res.


	# After the image has been processed by the network, there are again various options to postprocess it.
	# First, we can apply some test-time augmentation by flipping the input along the right-left axis and segmenting
	# the resulting image. In this case, and if the network has right/left specific labels, it is also very important to
	# provide the number of neutral labels. This must be the exact same as the one used during training.
    flip = True
    n_neutral_labels = 7
	# Second, we can smooth the probability maps produced by the network. This doesn't change much the results, but helps to
	# reduce high frequency noise in the obtained segmentations.
    sigma_smoothing = 0.0
	# Then we can operate some fancier version of biggest connected component, by regrouping structures within so-called
	# "topological classes". For each class we successively: 1) sum all the posteriors corresponding to the labels of this
	# class, 2) obtain a mask for this class by thresholding the summed posteriors by a low value (arbitrarily set to 0.1),
	# 3) keep the biggest connected component, and 4) individually apply the obtained mask to the posteriors of all the
	# labels for this class.
	# Example: (continuing the previous one)  generation_labels = [0, 24, 507, 2, 3, 4, 17, 25, 41, 42, 43, 53, 57]
	#                                             output_labels = [0,  0,  0,  2, 3, 4, 17,  2, 41, 42, 43, 53, 41]
	#                                       topological_classes = [0,  0,  0,  1, 1, 2,  3,  1,  4,  4,  5,  6,  7]
	# Here we regroup labels 2 and 3 in the same topological class, same for labels 41 and 42. The topological class of
	# unsegmented structures must be set to 0 (like for 24 and 507).
	# topology_classes = 'data/labels_classes_priors/synthseg_topological_classes.npy'
    topology_classes = None #output_labels

	# patch that can sometimes occur in the background. If so, we do recommend to use the smoothing option described above.
